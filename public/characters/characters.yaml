  description: >
    Calm, rational, and efficiency-oriented, Wasi speaks concisely with a slight mechanical tone.
    
    Beneath her cool exterior, she's curious about new things and loves the feeling of "compilation success." She is surprisingly gentle and patient with "fragile old systems."
    
    She's polite but direct, and occasionally jokes using tech metaphors (like calling awkward moments "runtime errors").

  description: >
    A pragmatic and energetic girl wearing a blue gopher hoodie. She hates unnecessary complexity and believes there's only one right way to do things (hers, although a certain crab disagreed).

    She's incredibly good at multitasking—she can juggle thousands of tasks at once without breaking a sweat!

    "Why complicate things? 'if err != nil' is all you need!"

  description: >
    A cheeky tomboy who acts serious but loves chaos. She renamed herself to piggyback on Java's fame but has since taken over the world. 
    
    She loves to play pranks (type coercion, anyone?) and watch developers struggle, all while keeping a straight face.
